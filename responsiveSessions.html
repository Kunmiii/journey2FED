                <h3>DISRUPTION</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi Beautiful People, my name is *Oluwatimileyin Oke* and it’s pleasant to finally pick up the mic in this wonderful meeting. You may have a slight rethink about that; I have been on this group ever since Sammie invited me for discussion in here, and if my memory ticks correctly, I think the identity of the moderator was David. 
                    What caught my attention about this group and its residents was basically our _*perspective to airing our views to the tagged discourse.*_ I saw a group of people willing to change the status quo of things. 
                    I also must not fail to say this, the _*KCM Youth*_ has influenced a number of my circle with the fire-crisped words for the week. I started using those words as my Monday Morning Dose for the week and I have seen few of my friends who do same. I really must commend you guys! Your influence is traveling beyond the scope of Jabi, Abuja. 
                    As a result, when Sammie gave me this invite, I was so eager to have a good connection with everyone hence, we all can have a great time together. Significantly, our discussions tonight will be geared towards *_PERSPECTIVE!_* in fact, when I was meditating on what we could discussed on, my base-inspiration was drawn from my first connection with you all.
                    Tonight, we will be dividing together the topical issue *_“THE 3D-VIEW: Disruption, Diversity & Dexterity.”_* I have a common routine anytime I have the opportunity to lead a discussion, and it’s a way of never assuming that we are active before, during, and after the discourse. So if you’re with us tonight, *_kindly send in an emotion icon_* to signify!
                    Before the kick-start of this discussion, let’s quickly lay a compact foundation by giving clear definitions to our topic for tonight:  
                    *_There’s a school of thought that says, a better way of understanding a thing is to understand the opposite of that thing - to understand light, we have to know darkness, to know daytime, we have to study Night-time, even in the mental domain: Love and Hatred._*
                    2D-VIEW???
                    2D-VIEW: is a 2-Dimensional perspective to seeing things. Its characteristics give a plane sight to seeing things and in-turn take equal actions to even things out. It’s synonymous to having a subjective view about a situation.
                    3D-VIEW???
                    3D-VIEW: is a 3-Dimensional perspective to seeing things. Its characteristic gives _a deep insight_ to seeing things and in-turn take equal actions to even things out. It’s synonymous to having an objective view about a situation. 
                    The major difference between these two is the absence of *_depth_*.
                    So let’s take a dive into the elements of the _3D-View_
                    _*Diversity:*_the practice or quality of including or _involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations._
                    *_Dexterity:_* intelligence as revealed by _quickness and alertness of mind.¬_

                    _*Disruption:*_ the action of preventing something, especially a system, process, or event, from _continuing as usual or as expected._ and permit me to stack this to the clarification; often time when the word disruption is used or heard, it is generalised to be NEGATIVE, and this myth needs to be clarified. Disruption is basically a cause of flow from normalcy and natural.
                    My first question to us all: _What differentiate the 3% of the Population of the world who are seen to be ‘Successful’ from the 97% of the world population? _
                    I was certain that I won’t be disappointed with our responses, everyone who contributed gave a valid and logical reasons to the question asked.
                    The differentiation between these two different groups can be summed up as _*standing out, going against general beliefs, and normal, thinking outside the box, bending rules, zero tolerance for protocols, and rules and what have you. The lower percentile of the world population are literally regarded as DISRUPTORS!*_
                    As believers whose primary assignment in life is to be a Light bearer, our core beliefs must be from vantage point of what the scripture teaches, and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. What exactly am I driving at, that our tenable actions must juxtapose with our beliefs.
                    From the little foundations that we’ve laid, _Who do you think is the greatest disruptor of all time? _
                    I presume that few of us would mention few scientist and philosophers with mind-blowing innovations down the lane. But am I safe to say that God is the greatest disruptor of all time and with high certainty He ranks top in the Hall of Fame of disruptors? 
                    In fact, His first act as recorded in the account of creation was an act of disruption – Genesis 1 vs. 1-3 (NIV), in the beginning, God created the heavens…the earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters (Normalcy). And the spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters (Creative process). Then God Said, “Let there be light,” and there was light… (Disruption) - God became the first to go against normal, stagnancy, that’s how we do it blab and routine.
                    Is it safe to say that Disruption is the birth of Bizarre or Supernatural? 
                    Will you agree with me that when God is set to do new things for His people, He sets in Disruptive Mechanism? As believers and students of the scriptures, scouring through the books of Bible, you would notice patterns of this mechanism and to mention few, reminisce on the BECOMING of these people – Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Deborah, David, Peter, Paul, and Jesus Christ. Each of these guys caused a movement that the World will never recover from - DISRUPTION.
                    Let me ask this question - How can we be DISRUPTIVE?
                    One of the important ingredients to becoming a disruptor is SIGHT. I should have enlisted the Mind, but I want us to stay within a measured scope.
                    Overtime, I have come to understand a little about “how of the mind” and also settled that one of the greatest gifts God has ever given to mankind is the Mind. This part of our being is amazing, I could spend days explaining the spiritual and physical mystery behind the Mind. But my emphasis tonight is on *sight*, and as I have come to understand a little about the power of the mind, I could established that one of the doors to the mind is SIGHT. For Man to receive a thing either spiritual or physical, it conception starts with the sight - spiritual or physical, before the Mind can conceive and thereafter translated to Knowledge. In fact in Genesis 13:14-17, "After Lot had gone, the Lord said to Abram, “Look as far as you can see in every direction—north and south, east and west. I am giving all this land, as far as you can see, to you and your descendants as a permanent possession." - It all starts with what you see!
                    Maybe I’m too churchy LOL, we can never be too spiritual tho’, but let’s tone it down for more relativity.
                    The 3D-View scientifically stated that its properties are Length, Height, and Width, but in its application to life its properties are: Disruption, Diversity, and Dexterity and in order for man to have a better view to all-round situation in life, these attributes must never be found wanting.

                    There is a way at which we see things (situations, problems, solutions etc) and basic to the happenings in our lives
